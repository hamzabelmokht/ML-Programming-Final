Good evening viewers,

in order to setup the code on your personal machine you will need 2 things
-Anaconda
-Jupyter Notebook 
(may work with collab but never tried)

1 Download the ipynb files and xlsx files from the repo
2 copy the path you have locally for xlsx location must be absolute path not relative
3 On the 4th block of code you will find a line like this: file_path = (r"C:\Users\hamza\Downloads\260324_ENG_MaizeForageSpainNWwtYearRadDay.xlsx") replace the path with your path and do not remove
the preceeding "r" or it will throw an error. 
4. from there one by one run each code portion beginning from the top in order if there are dependencies to install they will be automatically installed if not there will be a message saying already satisfied.
5. You're all set from here everything is straight forwards original comments in spanish due to this original code originating from a university in Spain.
